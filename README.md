# React-hooks
The application was created as part of completing the list 9 from the subject of Network Technologies - biomedical engineering, year III.


The goal was to create a simple application in React that would download and display universities in a given city and country using the University Domains and Names Data List & API.
There is a form at the top of the page for entering the country name
and the city. If you enter incorrect data, an error will be displayed in the form of a pop-up window. Below the form there is a button for clearing the list.
Each university is to be shown on the list (name + domain name as a hyperlink).
